machine learning
i worked as a data scientist for a manufacturing company. They are using vibration sensors to monitor the machinery within thei rproduction line and want to use this data for predictive maintenance
The aim is to be able to classify whether there is a fault with the machine based on the readings from the vibration sensors. I was provided with a dataset FaultDataset.csv. Each row contains twenty vibration sensor readings, and the final column identifies whether there was a fault with the machine at the time of the readings. 0 means there wasno fault with the machine and 1 means a fault was identified
